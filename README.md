Hello GitHub

A formative time in my life was spent in Maine, where I spent a winter without proper modern heating. During said winter, I had to find, gather, saw and split wood every day by hand for hours. My dreams at the time were of chainsaws, and I did manage to drastically improve my productivity by purchasing one. Who says that dreams don't come true?
